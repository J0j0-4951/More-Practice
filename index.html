          <p>My favorite animal is a fox.
             <br> I primarily like the red fox.
             <br> Foxes are interesting and their wild animals.
             <br> They also have pretty colors.

            <em>Fun facts!!!</em>
           <li>They live on every continent except Antarctica. 12 fox species belong to the “true foxes” group of genus “Vulpes”. Another 25 current or extinct species are usually called foxes.</li>
          <li>They also have vertical pupils that are similar to cats. These vertical pupils allow them to see in dim light. Dogs, on the other hand, have rounded pupils and cannot retract their claws.The similarities between foxes and cats do not end here. Foxes also have sensitive whiskers and spines on their tongues.</li>
          <li>The natural enemies of foxes include eagles, coyotes, and wolves.</li>
       <li>They are omnivores. From berries and rubbish to worms and birds, they can eat almost anything. But some species have a more specialized diet, for example, the crab-eating fox, they are not closely related to true foxes, though.</li>
